# Anomaly-Detection-using-Autoencoders
This code implements an anomaly detection system using an autoencoder neural network. Transaction data is normalized and only normal transactions are used for training. The model learns typical patterns and detects anomalies using reconstruction error. A threshold identifies suspicious transactions, and results are evaluated and visualized.
